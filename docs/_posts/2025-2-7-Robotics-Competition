title:  "Robotics Competition"
---
We participated in the biggest qualifier in the state at Van Wert Schools. We presented for a panel of judges, networked with other teams, and learned a lot about what it will take for us to be successful in this competition in future years. We did not rank very highly this year, but it was a great experience! Our robot, "Steve", had a catastrophic breakdown, and several of the upgrades we made after our experience at the Fort Loramie Scrimmage actually backfired. Still, we learned a lot from our new friends, especially the Fort Loramie Team and Team Juniper. We're very excited to have a majority of our members returning for next year, and a lot of new recruits, too!
