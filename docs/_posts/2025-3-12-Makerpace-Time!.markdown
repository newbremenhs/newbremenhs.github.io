title:  "Makerspace Time!"

A small group of 7th and 8th graders have started coming down to the Komminsk Center to work on elective projects! We've got a 3D Model of a Pokemon, a 3D Modeled Golf Ball Holder that looks like a putting green, and the beginnings of a computer using redstone in Minecraft:Education Edition. This is a group using some of their study hall time for extra projects, we've really been enjoying this extra opportunity!
