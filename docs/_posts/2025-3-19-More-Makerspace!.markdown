title:  "More Makerspace Time!"
---
One of our 8th graders revised his 3D model of a Pokemon, "Mega Shiny Rayquaza". It's always encouraging to see students show interest in a manufacturing process! For prints like this, we set each color as a separate layer, then set up our printer to pause between the layers so we can switch out the filament. This process has given students a lot of creative freedom, and we hope to make all kinds of creative builds this way!
