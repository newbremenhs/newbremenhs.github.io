title:  "Robots and Summer"
---
The fourth quarter really flew by this year. We structured the STEM rotation for the 7th and 8th graders a little differently, so they had more time to make upgrades to their robots. The results speak for themselves! These are some of the best robots I've seen students build, especially for students who have never built a working robot before. We played a bracket of robot sumo, and it has inspired me to push the boundaries of what these kids can do even further. I'm excited to see what we can do next year! For now, that was a lot of work, and we can all use a break.
